<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

[![Tech Blog Screen Shot][product-screenshot]](https://github.com/Pault26/14-Module-Tech-Blog)

This tech blog allows the user to create an account and share their thoughts! With a user-friendly interface and a seamless experience, our application provides a space for tech enthusiasts to connect, share their thoughts, and engage in meaningful discussions. This project was built using a Model, View, Controllers method and is deployed on Heroku. While the project itself is a simple application allowing the user to post and comment, there is great potential to add more functionality to the application. 

At the moment the Heroku application is not working. The link will be provided below once everything is up and running!

This repo is a replica of my other repo which I accidentally goofed around with too much and messed up. This is the new repo set up similar to the first!

### Built With

This application was built with the following:

* [![JavaScript][JavaScript]][JavaScript-url]
* [![Node.js][Node.js]][Node-url]
* [![Express][Express.js]][Express-url]
* [![Handlebars][Handlebars.js]][Handlebars-url]
* [![MySQL][MySQL]][MySQL-url]
* [![Sequelize][Sequelize]][Sequelize-url]
* [![Heroku][Heroku]][Heroku-url]

<p align="right">(<a href="#readme-top">back to top</a>)</p>

### Issues

Currently as it stands there is an issue with the project on Heroku. I have tried fixing several different things that were coming up under the --tail feature in Heroku CLI but nothing seems to work right now. Will be continuing to try to fix this feature but until now the repo is mostly complete.

See the [open issues](https://github.com/Pault26/14-Module-Tech-Blog/issues) for a full list of known issues.
